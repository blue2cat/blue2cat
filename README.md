### Hello, I'm GavinðŸ‘‹

My interests include cybersecurity, containerized technology, and the web. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Western Washington University. 

With experience in multiple industries, I have worked in technical roles where I contributed to the development and debugging of complex applications. I have completed projects in various programming and scripting languages, including JavaScript, Java, Python, C, and PowerShell.

I have taught multiple college-level classes covering topics such as web development and computer architecture.

Currently, I am working on a cybersecurity research project at Western Washington University that involves capturing, analyzing, and visualizing network traffic from IoT devices on home networks.

In my free time, I enjoy building and analyzing systems. This interest has myriad applications. Some projects I have completed include:
* Designing a Kubernetes replacement for a Docker-compose server solution
* Reverse engineering IoT firmware
* Writing elegant, secure server applications in C
* Designing PowerShell scripts that provide metrics on software versions across a network of servers
