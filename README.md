## Hello, I'm Gavin Stuart👋

A fullstack software engineer with experience in Typescript, React, C# and Python, I currently work with a Node/Express backend and React frontend. In my free time, I enjoy contributing code and documentation for open source projects. I also enjoy finding ways to break software and subsequently protect against such attacks.

Currently pursuing a Master’s in Cybersecurity at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Western Washington University. In addition to my technical work, I've had the privilege of teaching web development and computer architecture at Whatcom Community College.
