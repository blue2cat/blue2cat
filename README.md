## Hello, I'm Gavin Stuart👋

I'm a multidisciplinary software engineer and cybersecurity researcher. My current stack consists of Typescript, Node and React, but I write fluently in a number of languages. Currently pursuing a Master’s in Cybersecurity at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Western Washington University.

I work currently as a software developer and I have worked past roles in data science, systems administration and teaching. I taught college computer science classes including Computer Architecture and Web Development. 

I’m always excited to connect with others in the software engineering and cybersecurity communities. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss industry trends, tech, or collaboration opportunities.
