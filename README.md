Hello, I'm Gavin👋

I am passionate about cybersecurity, containerized technology, and web development. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Western Washington University.

Projects I've worked on include:
- [ARP Spoofing Utility in Python](https://github.com/blue2cat/spoof-py): Developed a comprehensive tool for ARP spoofing, allowing detailed control over network traffic interception.
- [React Dictionary App](https://github.com/blue2cat/react-dictionary): Built a dictionary application from the ground up using TypeScript and React Native.
- Multi-Client Server in C: Created a multi-client server using raw Linux system APIs to handle concurrent connections efficiently.
- [Raspberry Pi Hardware Monitoring](https://github.com/blue2cat/MonitorPi): Designed and implemented a hardware monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi for real-time data collection and analysis.

With hands-on experience across diverse technical roles, I've contributed to the development and debugging of sophisticated applications. My expertise spans several programming and scripting languages, including JavaScript, Java, Python, C, and PowerShell.

Additionally, I've had the opportunity to teach college-level courses on topics such as web development and computer architecture, sharing my knowledge and enthusiasm with fellow students.

Currently, I'm engaged in a cybersecurity research project at Western Washington University. This involves capturing, analyzing, and visualizing network traffic from IoT devices on home networks to understand security vulnerabilities.
