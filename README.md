## Hello, I'm Gavin Stuart👋

I am a skilled software engineer with a strong foundation in designing, implementing, debugging, and testing software in languages such as Python, C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript. My experience spans software engineering, network security, and full-stack development, with a particular interest in application security research. I am skilled at identifying security vulnerabilities at all levels of the stack and have experience working on remote, hybrid, and in-person teams.  
  
Currently pursuing a Master’s in Cybersecurity at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Western Washington University. With a solid understanding of both software development and systems engineering, I am well-equipped to contribute to teams focused on advancing technology while ensuring security is prioritized.  
  
In addition to my technical work, I have had the privilege of teaching web development and computer architecture at Whatcom Community College.  
  
I’m always excited to connect with others in the software engineering and cybersecurity communities. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss industry trends, tech, or collaboration opportunities.
